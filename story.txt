One day, I was walking down the street eating a Bratwurst. I had just left the flughafen in Berlin after a short flight listening to Rammstein. Until Rammstein actually pulled up with their Porsche's all equipped in their glossing Lederhose's absolutely ready to go down to the Biergarten. Suprisingly, they invited me to a secret party inside a Ratskeller, where they served the best Apfelkuchen I had ever tasted! The day got even crazier when they decided to race their cars down Hauptstrasse. That's not the wildest part, they barely avoided a runaway Mehlhase. To celebrate surviving the chaos, we stopped by a Bäckerei for some fresh Gebäck before everybody went home. Just as we thought the chaos had ended, a man in a Dirndl burst into the Bäckerei, frantically warning us that the rogue Mehlhase had returned with a gang. Each member was armed with a weapon in one hand and a delicious doner kebab in the other hand, ready for action.
